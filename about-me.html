						<h2>About me</h2>
						<p>Mad about learning and building better things for the web</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						An algorithms enthusiast focused on the Javascript tooling ecosystem. Learning by building
						transpilers, parsers and working with frameworks and contributing to open source projects. For
						his Bachelors major project, Karan worked on a Before-time Javascript code analysis tool, which,
						in a similar way to FB Prepack, identifies and removes JS code that won't execute or is
						redundant.
					</p>

					<p> For more than an year now Karan has been involved with Mozilla in various capacities involving
						Contributing code to Firefox Browser and as an Expert in the Mozilla Open Leaders program,
						advising & training the next batch of open source leaders.

						DevTools and Firefox Core Teams. He has also made contributions to the SpiderMonkey Garbage
						Collector.
					</p>
					<p>
						Earlier he was a mentee in the Mozilla Open Leaders Program, mentored and guided by Abigail
						Cabunoc and other open source exemplaries. Was leading the effort to establish a citizen
						maintained open source data portal for India, accessible in the form of a progressive web app,
						resistive to network issues and completely transparent in data sourcing and usage. As part of
						the mentorship, Karan learnt developing an open source community, effectively using CVS/CI
						systems and leading a team of internationally distributed contributors.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before that Karan worked on the National Data Portal project in the capacity of a Data
						management and Analysis Intern at NITI Aayog. He was instrumental in shaping the technical
						requirements and goals of the project through the technical inputs he provided. Karan also
						coordinated with various government departments and guided the departments in deploying the
						desired APIs for data communication. At NITI, he built and recommended the stack that would be
						used for the project through PoCs and demos for the same. Karan coordinated and guided the NIC
						team in handling the backend and making the portal update mechanism safer and simpler.
